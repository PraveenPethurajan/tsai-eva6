In the above neural network, 
```
- i1 and i2 are inputs to the network
- h1 and h2 are neuron in hidden layer 1
- a_h1 and a_h2 are output of activation functions applied to h1 and h2 respectively.
- o1 and o2 are output neurons
- a_o1 and a_o2 are output of activation functions applied to o1 and o2 respectively.
- E1 and E2 are error/loss of outputs a_o1 and a_o2 respectively.
- E_Total is sum of errors E1 and E2.
```
