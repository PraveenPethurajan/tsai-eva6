## Questions:
1. What are Channels and Kernels (according to EVA)?
2. Why should we (nearly) always use 3x3 kernels?
3. How many times do we need to perform 3x3 convolutions operations to reach close to 1x1 from 199x199 (type each layer output like 199x199 > 197x197...)
4. How are kernels initialized?
5. What happens during the training of a DNN?

## Answers:
1. - Kernels : 
	  - Suppose you have an image and you want to extract some useful features out of it, that is when you will need kernels.
	  - Kernel is a feature extractor.
	  - It is a tool or matrix ( generally 3*3) that convolves over an image(matrix) or feature map to extract one feature.
	  - It extracts some information from the given image and the information is stored in Neuron.
	  - Kernel creates channels from an image (Collection of neurons is a channel).
	    - Eg: A vertical edge detector kernel will extract all vertical edges from an image and the collection of all vertical edges in that image is a channel.
	  - Each kernel makes its own channel.
   - Channels : 
	  - A channel is a collection of single type feature extracted by kernels.
	  - Each channel contains similar information.
	  - Channels can be seen, but kernels cannot be seen.
	  - Information in channels depends on type of kernel/kernel values used to extract that information.
